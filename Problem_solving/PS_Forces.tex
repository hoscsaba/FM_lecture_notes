Find the axial force on the back of the impeller, whose outer diameter is $D_2=300$mm, the shaft diameter is $D_s=50$mm, the outlet pressure is $2.3$bar and the revolution number is 1470rpm. The average angular velocity of the fluid is 85\% of that of the impeller. (Solution: $F=9.36$kN)

Calculate the axial force acting on the supporting disc of a pump impeller of $280 mm$ diameter if the pressure at the impeller exit is $2 bar$. The hub diameter is $40 mm$. There is no leakage flow through the gap between the rotor supporting disc and the casing. The rotor speed is $1440/min$. The angular velocity of the circulating water is half of that of the rotor. Find the formula of pressure distribution as a function of the radial coordinate! Draw the cross section of the impeller and the axial pressure force! (Solution: $p(r)(\mathrm{Pa}) = 1.443\cdot 10^5 + 2.842\cdot 10^6 \cdot r^2$, $F_{ax} = 10418~\mathrm{N}$)
