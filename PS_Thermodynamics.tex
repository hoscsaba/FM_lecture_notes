The turbomachines conveying air are classified usually as fans ($p_2/p_1<1.3$), blowers ($1.3<p_2/p_1<3$) and compressors ($3<p_2/p_1$). Assuming $p_1=1\,\mathrm{bar}$ inlet pressure, $t_1=20^o\,\mathrm{C}$ inlet temperature and isentropic process ($\kappa=1.4$), find the the relative density change $(\rho_2-\rho_1)/\rho_1$ at the fan-blower border and the $t_2$ outlet temperature at the blower-compressor border. (Solution: $(\rho_2-\rho_1)/\rho_1=20.6\%$, $t_2=128.1^o\,\mathrm{C}$)

Gas is compressed from 1 bar absolute pressure to 3 bar \textbf{relative} pressure. The gas constant is $288$J/kgK, the specific heat at constant pressure is $c_p = 1005$J/kgK. The exponent describing the politropic compression is  $n = 1.54$. Find the isentropic exponent. Find the isentropic specific useful work, the specific input work and the isentropic efficiency.

Along a natural gas pipeline compressor stations are installed $L=75\,\mathrm{km}$ distance far from each other. On the pressure side of the compressor the pressure is $p_p=80\,\mathrm{bar}$, the density is $\rho=85\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, while the velocity of the gas is $v_p=6.4\,\mathrm{m/s}$. The diameter of the pipe is $D=600\,\mathrm{mm}$ the friction loss coefficient is $\lambda=0.018$. \textbf{Assuming that the process along the pipeline is isotherm}, the pressure loss is calculated as $\frac{p_{beg}^2-p_{end}^2}{2}=p_{beg}\lambda \frac{L}{D}\frac{\rho_{beg}}{2}v_{beg}^2$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Find the pressure, the density, and the velocity at the end of pipeline.
\item Find the mass flow through the pipeline.
\item Find the needed compressor power assuming that the compression is a politropic process and $n=1.45$.
\item Find the ratio of the compressor power and the power that could be released by the complete combustion of the transported natural gas. The heating value of the natural gas is $H=43\,\mathrm{MJ/kg}$. (Hint: $P_{comb}=\dot{m}H$)
