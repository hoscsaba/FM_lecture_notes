\chapter{Incompressible turbomachinery}

We classify as \emph{turbomachines} all those devices in which energy is transferred either to, or from, a continuously flowing fluid by the \emph{dynamic} action of one ore moving blase rows. Essentially, a rotating blade row, a rotor or an impeller changes the \emph{stagnation enthalpy} of the fluid moving through it. These enthalpy changes are intimately linked with the pressure changes in the fluid.

Up to 20\% relative density change, also gases are considered to be incompressible. Assuming isentropic process and ideal gas, this corresponds to $p_2/p_1 \approx 1.3$. Thus, pumps, fans, water and wind turbines are essentially the same machines.

\section{Euler's turbine equation}

Euler's turbine equation (sometimes called Euler's pump equation) plays a central role in turbomachinery as it connects the specific work $Y$ and the geometry and velocities in the impeller. In what follows, we give two derivations of the equation.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figs/euler_turbine_equation_fig.png}
\caption{\label{gen_turbom}Generalized turbomachine}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

{\bf Derivation 1: Moment of momentum}

Let us compute the moment of the force that is applied at the inlet and outlet of the generalized turbomachine shown in figure \ref{gen_turbom}:

\begin{equation}
\uvec{F}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left( m \uvec{c}\right)
\quad \rightarrow\quad
\uvec{M}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left( \uvec{r} \times m \uvec{c}\right)=\dot{m}\left( \uvec{r} \times \uvec{c}\right)
\end{equation}

where $m$ is the mass flow, and $\underline{c}$ is the velocity of the fluid on the radius $r$. We consider the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The inlet of the turbomachine is a circle with radius $r_1$, and the outlet with radius $r_2$.
  \item $\underline{c}$ velocity is considered constant in the sense that its length and angle are constant.
\end{itemize}
Thus $$ \uvec{M} = \uvec{M}_{out}-\uvec{M}_{in}=\dot{m}\left( \uvec{r}_2 \times \uvec{c}_2\right) - \dot{m}\left( \uvec{r}_1 \times \uvec{c}_1\right) $$.
With this the power need of driving the machine is
%
\begin{eqnarray}
	\dot m Y &= & P = \uvec{\omega} \uvec{M} = \left(\uvec{M}_{out}-\uvec{M}_{in}\right)\, \uvec{\omega}
	=\dot m \left[ \uvec{\omega} \left( \uvec{r}_2 \times \uvec{c}_2\right) - \uvec{\omega} \left( \uvec{r}_1 \times \uvec{c}_1\right) \right] \nonumber\\
	&=&\dot m \left[ \uvec{c}_2 \left( \uvec{\omega} \times \uvec{r}_2 \right) - \uvec{c}_1 \left( \uvec{\omega} \times \uvec{r}_1 \right) \right]
	=\dot m \left[ \uvec{c}_2 \uvec{u}_2 - \uvec{c}_1 \uvec{u}_1 \right] \nonumber\\
	&=&\dot m \left[ |\uvec{c}_2| |\uvec{u}_2| - |\uvec{c}_1| |\uvec{u}_1| \right]
	=\dot m \left( c_{2u} u_2 - c_{1u} u_1\right)
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $u_i = |\uvec{u}_i|$, and $c_i=|\uvec{c}_{2u}| cos(\alpha)$.
Comparing the beginning and the end of the equation, we see that the specific work is
\begin{equation}
\boxed{Y=c_{2u} u_2 - c_{1u} u_1}.
\end{equation}

{\bf Derivation 2: Rotating frame and reference and rothalpy}

The Bernoulli equation in a rotating frame of reference reads
%
\beq
\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{w^2}{2}+U = \mathrm{const.},
\eeq
%
where $U$ is the potential associated with the conservative force field, which is the potential of a rotating frame for reference: $U=-r^2\omega^2/2$. Let $w$ stand for the relative velocity, $c$ for the absolute velocity and $u=r \omega$ for the 'transport' velocity. We have $\uvec{c}=\uvec{u}+\uvec{w}$, thus $w^2=u^2+c^2-2u\,c=u^2+c^2-2u\,c_u$, which gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{w^2}{2}-\frac{r^2 \omega^2}{2}=\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{c^2+u^2-2c u}{2}-\frac{u^2}{2}=\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{c^2}{2}-\underbrace{c\,u}_{c_u u}=\mathrm{const}.
\end{equation}

Thus we see that the above quantity is conserved in a rotating frame of reference, which we refer to as \emph{rothalpy} (abbreviation of rotational enthalpy). Let us find now the change of energy inside the machine:
%
\begin{equation}
Y=\Delta \left(\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{c^2}{2}\right)=\Delta \left( c_u u\right),
\end{equation}
%
which is exactly Euler's turbine equation. (For compressible fluids, rothalpy is $I=c_p T+\frac{c^2}{2}-u c_{u}$.)

\section{Velocity triangles and performance curves} \label{sec:velocity_triangles_pumps}

% 		\caption{Velocity triangles at the inlet and at the outlet}
% 	\end{center}
% \end{figure}

% \note{VelocityTriangle figure added by Weber Richard}
From the Euler turbine equation we have:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta p_e = \rho g H = \rho \left( c_{2u}u_2 - c_{1u}u_1 \right)
\end{equation*}
%
where $H$ is the head of the pump. Known the velocity triangle's components and the density of the fluid, we get:
%
\begin{equation}\label{radial_head}
  H = \frac{c_{2u}u_2 - c_{1u}u_1}{g}
\end{equation}
%
The volume flow rate is
\begin{equation}\label{radial_flow}
  Q = c_{2m} A_2 =c_{2m} D_2 \pi b_2,
\end{equation}
%
where $D_2$ is the impeller outer diameter, $b_2$ is its flow-through width at the outlet. From \ref{radial_head} and \ref{radial_flow} we have that $\uvec{c}$ outlet absolute velocity is the connection between the head and the flow rate of the pump. Also one can notice, that if $ \Delta p_e$ increased, that is when $c_{2u}$ is increased than $Q$ decreases ($c_{2m}$ decreases). And if $\Delta p_e$ decreased ($c_{2u}$ decreased) than $Q$ increases ($c_{2m}$ increases). So our goal now is to find a relationship between the head and the flow rate of the pump.

\subsection{Radial (centrifugal) machines}

Let us consider a centrifugal pump and the velocity triangles at the impeller inlet and outlet, see Fig. \ref{fig:centrifual_pumps}. The theoretical volume flow rate is
%
\begin{equation}
Q_{th}=c_{2m} A_2 \Psi =c_{2m} D_2 \pi b_2 \Psi,
\end{equation}
%
where $D_2$ is the impeller outer diameter, $b_2$ is its flow-through width at the outlet and $c_{2m}$ is the radial component of the outlet absolute velocity. $\Psi<1$ is a constant called \emph{blockage factor} that takes into account that the real flow through area is smaller due to the blockage of the blade width at the outlet.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{\label{fig:centrifual_pumps_velocity_triangle}Centrifugal impeller with outlet velocity components.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The velocity triangle describes the relationship between the absolute velocity $c$, the circumferential velocity $u$ and the relative velocity $w$. Obviously, we have $\vec{c}=\vec{u}+\vec{w}$. Moreover, we know that (a) the circumferential velocity is $u=D \pi n$ and that (b) the relative velocity is tangent to the blade, i.e. the angle between $u$ and $w$ is approximately the blade angle $\beta$.

Basic trigonometrical identities show that $c_{2u}=u_2-c_{2m}/\tan \beta_2$. It is usual to assume that the flow has no swirling (circumferential) component at the inlet (due to Helmholtz's third theorem). In the reality, the outlet flow angle is not exactly $\beta_2$, thus the head is decreased, which is taken into account with the help of the \emph{slip factor} $\lambda$ (sometimes denoted by $\sigma$ in the literature).
%\end{minipage}

If there is no \emph{prerotation} (i.e. $c_{1u}=0$), we have
%
\begin{align}
H_{th}&=\lambda \frac{c_{2u} u_2}{g}=\lambda\left(\frac{u_2^2}{g}-\frac{u_2}{g}\frac{w_{2u}}{g}\right)=\lambda\left(\frac{u_2^2}{g}-\frac{u_2}{g}\frac{c_{2m}}{\tan \beta_2}\right)\nonumber \\
&=\lambda\left(\frac{u_2^2}{g}-\frac{u_2}{g\tan \beta_2 D_2 \pi b_2 \Psi}Q_{th}\right).
\end{align}

Thus, the theoretical performance curve $H_{th}(Q_{th})$ of a centrifugal machine is a straight line, which is (see Figure \ref{fig:blade_shapes})
\begin{itemize}
\item decreasing as $Q$ is increased, for \emph{backward curved} blades, i.e. $\beta_2<90^o$,
\item horizontal, for \emph{radial blades} ($\beta_2=90^o$) and
\item increasing (as $Q$ is increased) for \emph{forward curved} blades, i.e. $\beta_2>90^o$.
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\input{Problem_solving/PS_RadialVelocityTriangles.tex}

\subsection{Axial machines}

In the case of axial machines the flow leaves the impeller axially, see Fig. \ref{fig:axial_pumps}. The flow-through area is $\left(D_o^2-D_i^2\right)\pi/4$, where $D_o$ and $D_i$ stand for the outer and inner diameter of the lade, respectively. Notice that in this case, $u_1=u_2$ because it is assumed that the flow moves along a constant radius. Assuming (again) prerotation-free inlet ($c_{1u}=0$), we have $c_{2m}=c_1$ (due to continuity).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figs/axial_pump1.jpg}
\hspace{1cm}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figs/axialfanplate.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:axial_pumps}Axial pump (left) and axial fan (right)}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

However, an important difference between axial and centrifugal pumps (fans) is that in the case of axial machines, the pressure rise changes along the radial coordinate of the blade:
%
\beq
\Delta p_t(r)=\left.\rho u(r) \left(c_{2u}(r)-c_{1u}(r) \right)\right|_{c_{1u}=0}=\rho \left( 2 r \pi n \right) \left(2 r \pi n-\frac{c_{2m}}{\tan \beta_2} \right).
\eeq
%
Thus, if we wanted to obtain \emph{constant} $\Delta p_t$ along the radial coordinate, the change of the circumferential velocity has to be compensated by varying $\beta_2$.

%The twisted airfoil (aerofoil) shape of modern aircraft propellers was pioneered by the Wright brothers. While both the blade element theory and the momentum theory had their supporters, the Wright brothers were able to combine both theories. They found that a propeller is essentially the same as a wing and so were able to use data collected from their earlier wind tunnel experiments on wings. They also found that the relative angle of attack from the forward movement of the aircraft was different for all points along the length of the blade, thus it was necessary to introduce a twist along its length. Their original propeller blades are only about 5\% less efficient than the modern equivalent, some 100 years later. (Source: Wikipedia)

\subsection{Real performance curves} \label{sec:real_performance_curves_turbomachines}

Our analysis so far assumed that the flow inside the impeller is ideal (no losses) and that the streamlines are following the blade shape (thus, blade angles are also the streamline angles). However neither of these assumptions are true.

There are significant friction losses inside the impeller, the narrower the flow passage is, the higher the friction losses will be. Moreover, the volute also introduces friction losses. These losses are proportional to the velocity squared, thus $H'_{friction} \propto Q^2$.

On the other hand, if the angle of attack deviates from the ideal one, one experiences separation on the two sides of the blade. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:real_perf_curve} for a constant circumferential velocity $u$ as the flow rate and thus the inlet velocity $c$ is varied, the relative velocity $w$ also varies. At the design flow rate $Q_d$ the angle of attack ideal. For small flow rates, we have separation on the suction side of the blade, while for larger flow rates the separation is on the pressure side of the blade. Thus we have $H'_{separation} \propto (Q-Q_d)^2$.

To obtain the real performance curve, one has to subtract the above two losses from the theoretical head: $H=H_{th}(Q)-K_1 Q^2-K_2 (Q-Q_d)^2$, which is illustrated in \ref{fig:real_perf_curve}. Note that at the design point and close to it, the friction losses are moderate and no separation occurs. For lower flow rates, the friction loss decreases while separation increases. For higher flow rates, both friction and separation losses increase.

\section{Losses and efficiencies}

Let us analyse the losses that decrease the efficiency of a turbomachine (see Figure~\ref{fig:PumpLosses}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/PumpLosses.png}
\caption{\label{fig:PumpLosses}Losses of the pump.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Let the input mechanical power transmitted by the shaft be denoted by $P_{input}$. We have than

\begin{description}
\item[Mechanical losses $P'_m$] These represent the friction loss in the bearings and the mechanical sealing losses (if any). The remaining power is called \emph{internal power} $P_i=P_{input}-P'_m$.
%
\item[Disc friction losses $P'_{df}$] A significant shear force appears in the fluid entrapped between the housing and the impeller, which is taken into account by the \emph{disc friction coefficient}: $P'_{df}=\nu_{df} P_i$. The remaining power is the theoretical power of the impeller: $P_{th}=P_i-P'_{df}=(1-\nu_{df}) P_i$.
%
\item[Hydraulic and volumetric losses $P'_h$, $P'_v$] The theoretical head $H_{th}$ and flow rate $Q_{th}$ and is further decreased by the leakage flow rates ($Q_{l(eakage)}$) inside the pump (flow across the gaps between the impeller and the housing) and the internal frictional losses $h'$ (e.g. in the impeller and volute). We have
\begin{align}
P_{th}&=Q_{th} \rho g H_{th}=\left( Q+Q_{l}\right) \rho g \left( H+h'\right)=\underbrace{Q \rho g H}_{P_{u}}+\underbrace{Q_l \rho g H}_{P'_v}+\underbrace{Q_{th}\rho g h'}_{P'_h}\nonumber\\
&=Q\rho g H \frac{Q+Q_{l}}{Q}\frac{H+h'}{H}=Q\rho g H \underbrace{\frac{Q_{th}}{Q}}_{\eta_v^{-1}} \underbrace{\frac{H_{th}}{H}}_{\eta_h^{-1}} \quad \rightarrow \quad P_u=P_{th}\eta_h \eta_v
\end{align}

\section{Dimensionless numbers and affinity} \label{sec:dimensionless_numbers}

Based on the previously obtained formulae for theoretical head, we define dimensionless numbers as
\beq
H=\eta_h H_{th}=2 \eta_h \frac{c_{2u}}{u_2}\frac{u_2^2}{2g}:=\psi \frac{u_2^2}{2g}
\eeq
%
or, in the case of fans
\beq
\Delta p_t=\psi \frac{\rho }{2}u_2^2,
\eeq
%
where $\psi$ is a dimensionless pressure rise. Similarly, we have
%
\beq
Q=\eta_v Q_{th}=\eta_v D_2 \pi b_2 c_{2m}=\eta_v \frac{4 D_2 \pi b_2}{4 D_2^2} \frac{c_{2m}}{u_2} u_2 D_2^2:=\varphi \frac{D_2^2 \pi}{4}u_2
\eeq

These dimensionless quantities are called \emph{pressure number} $\psi$ and \emph{flow number} $\varphi$. What we found is that $H \propto n^2$ and $Q \propto n$ allowing the transformation of the performance curve given at $n_1$ to be computed to another revolution number $n_2$. This is called \emph{affinity law}:
%
\beq
\frac{H_1}{H_2}=\left( \frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)^2, \quad \frac{Q_1}{Q_2}=\frac{n_1}{n_2} \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{P_1}{P_2}=\left( \frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)^3
\eeq

As we have seen, both $\psi$ and $\varphi$ contains two parameters, $D_2$ and $u_2$, out of which one can be eliminated, resulting in new dimensionless numbers. Let us start with the elimination of $D_2$.
%
\begin{align}
\varphi&=\frac{Q}{\frac{D_2^2 \pi}{4}u_2}=\frac{4 Q}{D_2^3 \pi^2 n}\\
\psi&=\frac{H}{ \frac{u_2^2}{2g}}=\frac{2g H}{ D_2^2 \pi^2 n^2}
\end{align}
%
from which we have
%
\beq
\sigma=\frac{\varphi^{1/2}}{\psi^{3/4}}=\frac{2 \sqrt{Q}}{D_2^{3/2} \pi \sqrt{n}}\frac{ D_2^{3/2} \pi^{3/2} n^{3/2}}{\left(2g H\right)^{3/4}}=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt[4]{2} g^{3/4}} \underbrace{n \frac{Q^{1/2}}{H^{3/4}}}_{n_q}
\eeq
%
Note that $\sigma$ depends only on the revolution number but takes different values along the performance curve. Thus when actually computing it, one takes the data of the best-efficiency point. Moreover, we do not include the constant term$ \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt[4]{2} g^{3/4}}$. Finally, by definition, the \emph{specific speed} of a turbomachine is

\beq
n_q=n[rpm]\frac{\left(Q_{opt.}[m^3/s]\right)^{1/2}}{\left(H_{opt.}[m]\right)^{3/4}}
\eeq

Specific speed defines the shape of the impeller, low specific speed means low flow rate and high pressure rise (radial impeller) while high specific speed occurs when the flow rate is high and the pressure rise is low, see Fig. \ref{fig:nq}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/nq_eng.png}
\caption{\label{fig:nq}Specific speed and shape of the impeller.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Based on experience the available maximum efficiency can be estimated in the knowledge of $Q_{opt}$ and $n_q$ as follows

\beq
\eta_{max}=0.94-0.048 Q_{opt}^{-0.32}-0.29 \left(\log\left(\frac{n_q}{44}\right)\right)^2.
\eeq

Representing $\delta_{opt}(\sigma_{opt})$, turbomachines having good efficiency pass a narrow path. This diagram is called \emph{Cordier-diagram}. The centre of the path can be assumed with

\beq
\delta=\left(\frac{2.1}{1.41\log(\sigma)}\right)^{1.34}.
\eeq

Experience moreover shows that for a given $n_q$ estimation can be given for the ideal value of $\psi$ as follows

\beq
\psi=\left(\frac{300}{270+n_q}\right)^{9/4}.
\eeq

\section{Forces on the impeller}

%\subsection{Radial force}
%
%\fbox{TODO}

\subsection{Axial force}
\note{Axial Force is written by Weber Richard}

The axial force results from two components:
\begin{itemize}
\item Momentum force
\item Pressure distribution on the hub(back of the impeller) and shroud(front of the impeller).
\end{itemize}

The overall axial force is
%
\beq
F_{ax}=F_{hub}-F_{shroud}+F_{impulse}+ \underbrace{mg,}_{\text{in case of vertical impeller}}
\eeq
%
and its direction is towards the suction side (the axial force tries to 'pull down' the impeller from the shaft).
The impulse force is
\beq
F_{impulse}=\dot{m} v =  \underbrace{\rho Q}_{\dot{m}}  \underbrace{\frac{Q}{A_1}}_{c_{in}} = \rho \frac{Q^2}{A_1}.
\eeq
The force on the hub and the shroud can be calculated from the pressure distribution along the impeller. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/AxialForces.png}
\caption{\label{fig:ax_force}Pressure distribution on the hub.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In general for a rotating frame the pressure distribution is 
\beq
p(r) =  K + \frac{\rho}{2} (r \omega_f)^2,
\eeq
where $K$ is a constant and $\omega_f$ is the angular velocity of the fluid.

$K$ can be calculated from the boundary condition. Since the pressure exactly known at the end of the impeller ($r=r_2$). For the hub this is
\beq
p_h(r_2)=p_2 \quad \rightarrow \quad p_h(r)=p_2-\frac{\rho}{2}\omega_f^2\left( r_2^2-r^2\right).
\eeq
In case of the shroud a pressure drop ($\Delta p_2$) is reducing the pressure at the boundary:
\beq
p_s(r_2)=p_2-\Delta p_2 \quad \rightarrow \quad p_s(r)=p_2-\Delta p_2-\frac{\rho}{2}\omega_f^2\left( r_2^2-r^2\right).
\eeq
The forces can be evaluated as the definite integral of the pressure distribution.
The axial force becomes on the hub (back of the impeller):
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{hub} &=&\int_{r_s}^{r_2} 2 r \pi p_h(r) dr = 2 \pi \int_{r_s}^{r_2} p_2 r - \frac{\rho}{2} \omega_f^2 \left(r_2^2 r-r^3\right)dr = \nonumber \\
 &=& 2 \pi \left[ p_2 \frac{r_2^2 - r_s^2}{2} - \frac{\rho}{2} \omega_f^2 \left( r_2^2 \frac{r_2^2-r_s^2}{2} - \frac{r_2^4-r_s^4}{4} \right) \right] = \nonumber\\
&=& 2 \pi \frac{r_2^2-r_s^2}{4} \left[ p_2 - \frac{\rho}{2} \omega_f^2 \left( r_2^2 - \frac{r_2^2-r_s^2}{2} \right) \right],
\end{eqnarray}
finally
\begin{equation}
F_{hub}  =\left( r_2^2-r_s^2\right)\pi \left( p_2-\frac{\rho}{2}\omega_f^2\frac{r_2^2-r_s^2}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
%
A similar result is obtained for the shroud (front of the impeller) with replacing $r_s$ by $r_1$:
\begin{equation}
F_{shroud} = \left( r_2^2-r_1^2\right)\pi \left( p_2 - \Delta p_2-\frac{\rho}{2}\omega_f^2\frac{r_2^2-r_1^2}{2}\right).
\end{equation}

\section{Cavitation}
\note{written by Weber Richard}

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=13cm]{figs/cavitation.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:cavitation}Representation of the cavitation.}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Two similar arrangement can be seen on left side of Figure \ref{fig:cavitation}. The only difference is the height of the pump, although this cause major deviation in the pressure distribution along the pipe line as it can be observed on the right side of the Figure. In the worst cases the pressure can be below the saturation vapour pressure which means locally the vapour bubbles are appearing. This is called cavitation. The vapour pressure is usually a function of the temperature, e.g.  for water:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}
	$t[C]$ & 10 & 20 & 40 & 60 & 80 & 100 \\
	$p_v [bar]$ & 0.012 & 0.02 & 0.07 & 0.2 & 0.47 & 1\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

There could be three major consequences of the cavitation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increased noise among vibration,
\item Drastic decrease in hydraulic performance curve: $H-Q$,
\item Damage of the impeller, see Figure \ref{fig:cavitation_damage}.
\end{itemize}

	\includegraphics[width=13cm]{figs/cavitation_damage.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:cavitation_damage}Illustration of the cavitation damage in pumps.}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH)}

To avoid cavitation it is not sufficient to ensure that the pressure at the suction side is larger than the vapour pressure ($p_s > p_v$). Since  inside the pump there is a complex flow, therefore it is possible to have $p<p_s$ locally where the velocity is large enough. Ensuring the operational work without cavitation the $\mathit{NPSH}$ has to be defined. It is convenient to split the absolute pressure at the pressure side $p_s$ into two parts: $p_v$ vapour pressure plus the part above that, deonted by $\rho g \times NPSH$:
%
\begin{equation}
p_s = p_v + \rho g \times \underbrace{\mathit{NPSH}}_{\text{Net Positive Suction Head}}
\end{equation}
%
this way, the NPSH value gives the net "standby" pressure \emph{above} the vapour pressure that is available before cavitation occurs.

There are two different $\mathit{NPSH}$ values: available ($\mathit{NPSH}_a$) and the required ($\mathit{NPSH}_r$):

\begin{itemize} 
	\item {\bf The available $\mathit{NPSH}_a$} is a {\bf property of the hydraulic system} (geometry, loss coefficients etc. of the pipelines and tanks) and can be evaluated as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathit{NPSH}_a = \frac{p_t - p_v(T)}{\rho g} - H_s - h'(Q),
\end{eqnarray}
where the $h'(Q)$ represents the frictional losses at the suction-side pipeline (see later in Section \ref{sec:frictionallosses}). 
%
\item {\bf The required $\mathit{NPSH}_r$} value can be found {\bf in the catalogue of the pump}. It is usually depending on the volume flow rate similarly to the head. 
\end{itemize}

The condition for avoiding the cavity is that the available $\mathit{NPSH}$ must be larger than the required $\mathit{NPSH}$, mathematically:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathit{NPSH}_a > \mathit{NPSH}_r \hspace{1cm} \Longleftrightarrow \hspace{1cm} \text{\textbf{no cavitation}}
\end{eqnarray}
