A radial impeller runs at n=1440/min revolution speed and conveys $Q=40$ l/s of water. The diameter of the impeller is $D= 240$ mm, the outlet width is $b_2=20$ mm. The blade angle at the outlet is $\beta_2 = 25$ degrees. The inlet is prerotation-free. Find the theoretical head and draw a qualitatively proper sketch of the velocity triangle at the outlet. (Solution: $H_{th}=22.9$m)

The mean meridian velocity component of a radial impeller with $D_2=400$ mm diameter at $n=1440$rpm revolution speed is $c_m= 2.5$ m/s. The angle between the relative and circumferential velocity components is $\beta_2=25$ degrees. With a geometrical change of the blade shape, this angle is increased to to 28 degrees, that results in 10\% drop of the meridian velocity component. The inlet is prerotation-free. Find the relative head change. (Solution: $(H_{25^o}-H_{28^o})/H_{25^o}=4.6$\%)
